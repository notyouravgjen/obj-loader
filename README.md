## License

I haven't chosen a license yet. I'm not sure what license would be appropriate given that I followed a tutorial to create the code.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to rastertek.com for the tutorial.

Thanks to my project partners Chris Cordi, Brockton Roth, Evan Gifford, and Evan Miller for working on the game with me.
